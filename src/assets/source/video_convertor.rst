VideoConvertor
==============

More like to-mp4-convertor. VideoConvertor transcodes from
pre-selected source folders to target folders with given
settings for those folders. It is a batch converter I did
with a friend for his needs or wants.

VideoConvertor is written in Python and Tkinter. Video
transcoding happens using ffmpeg and MoviePy. This project
was a learning experience in Tkinter.
