Lights Out
==========

Lights Out is a Discord bot that can give light signals and
effects using LIFX smart lights when a registered user is
being mentioned on a server the bot is on.

Accompanied is a website for inputting light settings,
LIFX developer token and user's discord tag. Notification
settings can be toggled in Discord, and light notifications
from selected users can be ignored on discord as well.

This project is written entirely in Python, Django and
discord.py.

Currently offline.
