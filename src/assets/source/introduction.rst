Hello! My name is Mikko Kujala and I'm an aspiring web developer.
Below are some facts about me.

- I'm thirty-eight years old.
- I'm a male.
- I live in Helsinki, Finland.
- I recently graduated from Helsinki Business College as datanome. Yep, I want
    to change careers.
- I'm looking for work. :)

I have mainly experience in Python. I've dabbled into a number of other
languages, but Python remains the strongest one. In addition to programming I
have acquired some Linux knowledge so as to deploy what I have written.
This personal website has been written in JavaScript using Vue as a learning
project. I plan to show some of what I have done here in hopes of grabbing
employer attention =). I hope you like this site.

Best regards,

-Mikko
